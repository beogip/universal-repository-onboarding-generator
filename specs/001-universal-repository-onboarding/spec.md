**Feature Branch**: `001-universal-repository-onboarding`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Universal Repository Onboarding Generator v3.0.0 with advanced template system and automated NPX installation process for consistent onboarding documentation generation"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE: Enhanced onboarding generator with templates and NPX installer
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE: actors (developers, maintainers), actions (install, generate), data (templates, config), constraints (4-hour contribution goal)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE: No unclear aspects identified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE: Clear user flow from installation to documentation generation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE: All requirements are testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE: Templates, configuration, generated documentation
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETE: No implementation details, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a repository maintainer, I want to easily install an onboarding documentation generator so that new developers can understand the codebase, set up their environment, and make their first meaningful contribution within 4 hours, with consistent quality documentation across all repositories.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a repository without onboarding documentation, **When** I run the installation command, **Then** the system creates template files, configuration, and the main generator prompt in appropriate directories within 5 minutes.
2. **Given** a repository with the generator installed, **When** I trigger the documentation generation, **Then** the system analyzes the repository and produces tailored onboarding documentation using templates that match the detected technology stack.
3. **Given** generated onboarding documentation, **When** a new developer follows it, **Then** they can complete environment setup in ‚â§30 minutes, understand core architecture in ‚â§20 minutes, and identify contribution opportunities in ‚â§10 minutes.
4. **Given** an existing installation, **When** I re-run the installer, **Then** the process is safe, preserves customizations, and can be repeated without data loss.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the repository uses an unsupported or mixed technology stack?
- How does the system handle repositories with existing onboarding documentation?
- What occurs if the installation process is interrupted or fails midway?
- How does the generator behave with repositories that have restricted file permissions?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow installation via a single NPX command that analyzes the repository and sets up all necessary files
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect repository technology stack, architecture patterns, and project structure
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate onboarding documentation using templates tailored to the detected technology stack
- **FR-004**: System MUST create documentation that enables new developers to make their first meaningful contribution within 4 hours
- **FR-005**: System MUST limit total generated documentation to ‚â§1500 lines across all files for focused, scannable content
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that all generated content references actual repository files, commands, and structure (no fictional content)
- **FR-007**: System MUST create documentation with time estimates for setup (‚â§30 min), architecture understanding (‚â§20 min), and contribution identification (‚â§10 min)
- **FR-008**: Installation process MUST be idempotent and safe to repeat without destroying existing customizations
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain template files locally for customization and offline generation
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with VS Code Copilot for interactive AI-guided onboarding assistance

### Key Entities

- **Onboarding Template**: Structured file defining content format and sections for each type of documentation (README, setup guide, examples, troubleshooting)
- **Repository Configuration**: Local settings file storing installation preferences, detected technologies, and customization options
- **Generated Documentation**: Complete set of onboarding files tailored to the repository, including overview, setup instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines
- **AI Integration Prompt**: Specialized instruction file that enables context-aware assistance for developers during onboarding

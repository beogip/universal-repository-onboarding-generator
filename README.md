## 🎯 Overview

The Universal Repository Onboarding Generator is an AI-powered tool that automatically analyzes any repository and creates tailored onboarding documentation for new developers. It works with any technology stack - from web applications to data science projects - and generates comprehensive documentation that explains the codebase, setup requirements, development workflows, and contribution guidelines.

**Key Features:**

- 🔍 **Smart Analysis**: Automatically detects repository type, technology stack, and architecture patterns
- 📚 **Adaptive Documentation**: Creates tailored documentation based on what's actually in the repository
- 🤖 **Interactive Tech Leader**: Generates an AI mentor prompt for guided onboarding sessions
- 🌍 **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any repository type and technology stack
- ⚡ **Optimized Performance**: v2.0 is 57% more efficient while maintaining full functionality

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
- Access to any repository (public or private)

### Usage

1. Open any repository in VS Code
2. Run the command: `@workspace /repo-onboarding`
3. Wait for analysis and documentation generation
4. Find your onboarding documentation in `.copilot/onboarding/`

## 📁 Generated Documentation Structure

The tool creates a complete onboarding package:

```
.copilot/onboarding/
├── README.md                    # Project overview and quick start
├── setup-guide.md              # Installation & environment setup
├── tech-leader-walkthrough.md  # Interactive AI mentor prompt
├── examples/
│   ├── basic-usage.md          # Simple examples
│   └── advanced-workflows.md   # Complex scenarios
└── [conditional files based on repository]
    ├── development-workflow.md  # Contributing guidelines
    ├── architecture-overview.md # System architecture
    ├── api-documentation.md     # API reference
    ├── testing-guide.md         # Testing strategies
    ├── deployment-guide.md      # Deployment processes
    ├── troubleshooting.md       # Common issues
    └── resources.md             # Learning materials
```

## 🤖 Interactive Tech Leader Experience

One of the most powerful features is the generated **Tech Leader Walkthrough**. This creates a specialized AI prompt that acts as an experienced senior developer who knows your repository inside and out.

### What the Tech Leader Does:

- **Personalized Assessment**: Evaluates your technical background and goals
- **Guided Repository Tour**: Walks you through the codebase structure and patterns
- **Hands-on Learning**: Uses real examples from your repository
- **Contribution Ready**: Helps identify and implement your first meaningful contribution

### How to Use:

1. Open `tech-leader-walkthrough.md` from the generated documentation
2. Copy the AI prompt provided
3. Start a new conversation with GitHub Copilot
4. Paste the prompt to begin your personalized onboarding journey

## 🛠 Supported Repository Types

The generator automatically adapts to various repository types:

- **Web Applications** (React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS/HTML)
- **Backend Services** (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, PHP, etc.)
- **Mobile Applications** (React Native, Flutter, native iOS/Android)
- **Desktop Applications** (Electron, .NET, Java, C++)

   - Detects repository type, technology stack, and architecture patterns
   - Analyzes directory structure, configuration files, and dependencies

2. **📋 Smart Documentation Generation Strategy**

   - Determines which documentation files are needed
   - Applies intelligent conditional logic based on repository content

3. **📝 Technology-Specific Content Creation**

   - Creates all core documentation files
   - Generates only justified conditional files
   - Uses real examples from the actual codebase

4. **🤖 Interactive Tech Leader Walkthrough Generation**

   - Creates a specialized AI mentor prompt
   - Includes unified operational constraints
   - Implements 4-phase interactive learning flow

5. **✅ Final Validation & Quality Assurance**
   - Verifies all files were created correctly
   - Validates cross-references and accuracy
   - Provides completion report

# Setup Guide - Universal Repository Onboarding Generator

## Essential Setup (≤ 30 minutes)

### Prerequisites ⏱️ 5 minutes

**Required:**

- ✅ VS Code installed
- ✅ GitHub Copilot extension active
- ✅ Access to target repository (public or private)

**System Requirements:**

- Any operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- No additional installations required
- Works entirely within VS Code environment

### Step 1: Get the Prompt ⏱️ 3 minutes

**Option A: Use from this repository**

1. Navigate to `src/repository-onboarding-generator.instructions.md`
2. Copy the entire prompt content
3. You're ready to use it in any repository

**Option B: Direct execution (if available)**

- Some configurations may support: `@workspace /repo-onboarding`

### Step 2: Target Repository Setup ⏱️ 2 minutes

1. **Open target repository** in VS Code
2. **Ensure Copilot is active** (check status bar)
3. **Verify repository access** (can read files and structure)

### Step 3: Execute the Generator ⏱️ 15 minutes

1. **Start new Copilot conversation**
2. **Paste the full prompt** from `src/repository-onboarding-generator.instructions.md`
3. **Wait for analysis** (typically 10-15 minutes depending on repository size)
4. **Review generated files** in `doc/onboarding/` and `.github/instructions/`

### Step 4: Verify Setup ⏱️ 5 minutes

**Check generated documentation:**

- ✅ `doc/onboarding/README.md` exists with project overview
- ✅ `doc/onboarding/setup-guide.md` exists with setup instructions
- ✅ `doc/onboarding/examples/` folder contains usage examples
- ✅ `.github/instructions/tech-leader-walkthrough.instructions.md` exists

**Test interactive Tech Leader:**

- ✅ Ask Copilot: "help me understand this codebase"
- ✅ Tech Leader should activate automatically
- ✅ Follow the 4-phase interactive walkthrough

## Complete Setup (Additional Options)

### Advanced Usage Patterns

**For Team Environments:**

- Share the generated documentation with team members
- Customize examples with team-specific workflows
- Update documentation as repository evolves

**For Multiple Repositories:**

- Save the prompt for reuse across projects
- Create documentation standards based on generated output
- Establish onboarding metrics using generated success criteria

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue 1: Prompt doesn't execute properly**

- ✅ **Solution**: Ensure entire prompt is copied (check for truncation)
- ✅ **Verification**: Prompt should start with "You are an expert repository analysis"

**Issue 2: Incomplete documentation generation**

- ✅ **Solution**: Repository may be too complex - try with smaller codebase first
- ✅ **Verification**: Check if at least 3 core files were generated

**Issue 3: Tech Leader doesn't activate**

- ✅ **Solution**: Verify `.github/instructions/` file exists and ask specific onboarding questions
- ✅ **Verification**: Try phrases like "repository walkthrough" or "onboarding guidance"

### Validation Checklist

Before considering setup complete:

- [ ] Can generate documentation for a test repository
- [ ] Generated documentation is relevant to repository content
- [ ] Interactive Tech Leader responds to onboarding requests
- [ ] Documentation follows the expected structure
- [ ] Time estimates in generated docs are reasonable

## Next Steps

1. **Try with a simple repository first** (recommended: small open-source project)
2. **Review generated documentation quality**
3. **Test interactive Tech Leader experience**
4. **Customize templates as needed for your team**
5. **Scale to larger, more complex repositories**

**Total Setup Time**: Essential setup should take ≤ 30 minutes. Complete setup and customization may take up to 1-2 hours depending on your specific requirements.

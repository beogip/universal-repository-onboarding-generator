# Advanced Workflows and Repository Types

## Complex Repository Scenarios

### Monorepo with Multiple Tech Stacks

**Repository Example**: Large enterprise monorepo with React frontend, Node.js API, Python data processing, and infrastructure code.

**Generator Behavior:**
- Detects multiple technology stacks
- Creates consolidated documentation focusing on main entry points
- Generates conditional files for complex architecture
- Tech Leader adapts questions to cover all relevant stacks

**Generated Structure:**
```
doc/onboarding/
├── README.md                      # Multi-stack overview
├── setup-guide.md                # Docker/unified setup approach
├── architecture-overview.md       # Service relationships and data flow
├── examples/
│   ├── basic-usage.md            # Simple development workflow
│   └── advanced-workflows.md     # Cross-service development
└── troubleshooting.md            # Common integration issues
```

**Tech Leader Adaptation:**
```
Tech Leader: "I see you're working with a monorepo. Which area interests you most?"
User: "The React frontend"
Tech Leader: "Great! The frontend is in /packages/web. Let's start there..."
```

### Data Science Repository

**Repository Example**: Machine learning project with Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, data pipelines, and model deployment.

**Generator Behavior:**
- Recognizes data science patterns (notebooks, requirements.txt, data/ folders)
- Focuses on environment setup (conda/pip)
- Emphasizes data workflow and model lifecycle
- Provides notebook execution examples

**Specialized Content:**
```markdown
## Essential Setup - Data Science Project

### Environment Setup (20 minutes)
1. Install Anaconda/Miniconda
2. Create environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Activate environment: `conda activate project-name`
4. Launch Jupyter: `jupyter lab`

### First Contribution - Data Analysis
1. Open `notebooks/exploration.ipynb`
2. Run existing cells to understand data pipeline
3. Add new analysis in empty cells
4. Document findings in markdown cells
```

### Legacy Codebase Migration

**Repository Example**: Large legacy application being modernized, mixed old and new patterns.

**Generator Behavior:**
- Identifies legacy patterns and modern additions
- Creates migration-focused documentation
- Emphasizes understanding existing patterns before changes
- Provides safe contribution areas for newcomers

**Migration-Focused Documentation:**
```markdown
## Architecture Overview - Legacy Modernization

### Current State
- **Legacy Core**: PHP monolith in `/legacy/`
- **New Services**: Node.js microservices in `/services/`
- **Migration Progress**: 40% of features modernized

### Safe Contribution Areas for New Developers
1. **New Features**: Always implement in `/services/`
2. **Bug Fixes**: Legacy fixes in `/legacy/`, new logic in services
3. **Tests**: Add test coverage for modernized components
```

## Advanced AI Tech Leader Interactions

### Multi-Developer Onboarding Session

**Scenario**: Team onboarding with varying experience levels.

**Tech Leader Adaptation:**
```
Tech Leader: "I see multiple team members. Let me assess everyone's background..."

[Assesses each person individually]

Tech Leader: "Based on the team's experience, I'll focus on:
- Architecture overview for the senior developers
- Step-by-step setup for the junior developers  
- Specific contribution opportunities for each role"
```

### Deep Architecture Dive

**Scenario**: Experienced developer wants comprehensive understanding.

**Advanced Walkthrough Flow:**
1. **System Design Discussion**
   - Design patterns and architectural decisions
   - Performance considerations and bottlenecks
   - Scalability and maintenance strategies

2. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Review existing code patterns
   - Explain testing strategies and coverage expectations
   - Discuss code review processes and standards

3. **Advanced Debugging Techniques**
   - Common issues and debugging approaches
   - Performance monitoring and optimization
   - Integration testing and deployment validation

### Cross-Team Knowledge Transfer

**Scenario**: Repository ownership transitioning between teams.

**Knowledge Transfer Focus:**
```
Tech Leader: "Since this is a team transition, let's focus on:

1. **Critical Business Logic**: Where the core functionality lives
2. **Operational Concerns**: Deployment, monitoring, incident response
3. **Technical Debt**: Known issues and planned improvements
4. **Dependencies**: External services and integration points"
```

## Complex Workflow Examples

### Feature Development Lifecycle

**Complete workflow from idea to production:**

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Use generated architecture overview to understand impact
   - Reference troubleshooting guide for known constraints
   - Check examples for similar implementations

2. **Development Process**
   - Follow setup guide for local environment
   - Use development workflow documentation for branching strategy
   - Reference testing guide for coverage expectations

3. **Code Review and Deployment**
   - Follow contribution guidelines from generated docs
   - Use deployment guide for release process
   - Reference monitoring and rollback procedures

### Emergency Bug Fix Workflow

**Fast-track process for critical issues:**

```markdown
## Emergency Bug Fix Process

### Step 1: Quick Understanding (10 minutes)
- Read README.md Quick Start section
- Identify affected component from architecture overview
- Check troubleshooting guide for known issues

### Step 2: Fast Setup (15 minutes)  
- Use "Essential Setup" from setup guide (skip complete setup)
- Focus on minimal environment for specific component
- Use existing examples to validate setup

### Step 3: Implement Fix (varies)
- Follow hotfix branching strategy from development workflow
- Focus on minimal, safe changes
- Use testing guide for critical path validation
```

## Repository Evolution Patterns

### Documentation Maintenance

**As repository grows and changes:**

1. **Regenerate Documentation**: Run generator periodically to catch architecture changes
2. **Validate Examples**: Ensure generated examples still work with current codebase  
3. **Update Success Metrics**: Adjust time estimates based on actual onboarding experiences
4. **Evolve Tech Leader**: Update AI mentor based on new patterns and common questions

### Scaling the Generator

**Using across organization:**

```markdown
## Organization-Wide Adoption

### Standard Documentation Structure
- Consistent onboarding experience across all repositories
- Shared patterns and terminology
- Unified AI mentor experience

### Customization Guidelines  
- Team-specific setup requirements
- Organization-specific tools and processes
- Internal resource links and contacts

### Success Metrics Tracking
- Average onboarding time across repositories
- First contribution success rates
- Documentation satisfaction scores
```

**Time Investment vs. Value:**
- Initial setup: 30 minutes per repository
- Long-term maintenance: 1-2 hours per quarter
- Developer productivity gain: 50-75% faster onboarding
- Knowledge retention: Significantly improved with interactive learning
